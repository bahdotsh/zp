# Implementation Progress Report

This document tracks the progress of implementing the clipboard history sync feature according to the checklist in plan.md.

## Phase 1: Preparation

- [x] Design and implement enhanced ClipboardHistoryEntry struct
  - Added device_id, sync_status, and entry_id fields
  - Implemented Default trait for SyncStatus

- [x] Create SyncConfig struct and configuration file
  - Created SyncConfig with enabled, sync_dir, device_name, auto_merge, and conflict_resolution fields
  - Implemented load_sync_config and save_sync_config functions
  - Added default configuration generation

- [x] Add command-line options for sync configuration
  - Added --sync-enable, --sync-disable, --sync-status, --sync-dir, and --sync-device-name options
  - Implemented handlers for these options in main.rs

- [x] Update JSON serialization/deserialization for new structures
  - Enhanced ClipboardHistoryEntry with proper serde attributes
  - Implemented proper serialization for sync configuration

- [x] Create device identification mechanism
  - Implemented get_device_id() function that creates and persists a unique device ID
  - Created UUID-based entry IDs with generate_entry_id()

## Phase 2: Basic Functionality

- [x] Implement sync directory file watching
  - Created SyncHandler with file system watching using notify crate
  - Implemented event handling for sync file changes

- [x] Create sync file format and conversion utilities
  - Using JSON format for sync files compatible with the existing history format
  - Added support for the enhanced ClipboardHistoryEntry structure

- [x] Modify clipboard history saving to update sync file
  - Updated save_clipboard_history to also write to the sync file when sync is enabled
  - Implemented sync_clipboard_entry function

- [x] Implement import mechanism from sync file
  - Added import_from_sync_file function in SyncHandler
  - Implemented file event handling to trigger imports

- [x] Add basic merge functionality for histories from different devices
  - Implemented merge_entries function with conflict resolution strategies

## Phase 3: Conflict Resolution

- [x] Implement conflict detection algorithm
  - Added detection of conflicts based on entry_id field
  - Implemented handling of entries from different devices

- [x] Add configurable conflict resolution strategies
  - Added ConflictResolutionStrategy enum with multiple strategies
  - Implemented strategy-based conflict resolution

- [x] Create sync status tracking for entries
  - Added SyncStatus enum with LocalOnly, Synced, and Conflicted states
  - Tracking sync status in clipboard entries

- [ ] Implement UI indicators for sync status
  - Not yet implemented in the UI

- [ ] Add manual conflict resolution interface
  - Not yet implemented

## Phase 4: Robustness and User Experience

- [x] Implement error handling for sync failures
  - Added proper error handling in sync_clipboard_entry and import_from_sync_file

- [ ] Add recovery mechanisms for corrupted sync files
  - Basic error handling implemented, but comprehensive recovery not yet done

- [x] Create comprehensive logging for sync events
  - Added logging messages for major sync events

- [x] Write user documentation for setup and usage
  - Created CLIPBOARD_SYNC_README.md with detailed instructions

- [ ] Perform cross-platform testing
  - Not yet performed

## Phase 5: Optimization and Refinement

- [ ] Optimize sync performance for large histories
  - Not yet implemented

- [ ] Implement bandwidth and resource usage controls
  - Not yet implemented

- [ ] Add sync statistics and monitoring
  - Basic status reporting implemented, detailed statistics not yet done

- [ ] Perform security review of sync implementation
  - Not yet performed

- [ ] Add automated tests for sync functionality
  - Not yet implemented

## Next Steps

1. Implement the UI indicators for sync status
2. Create a manual conflict resolution interface
3. Add comprehensive recovery mechanisms for corrupted sync files
4. Perform cross-platform testing
5. Enhance the file-based sync mechanism with more robust features

## Notes on Implementation Approach

We've adapted our approach from Option 2 (embedded Syncthing library) to a pure file-based synchronization mechanism due to challenges with the Syncthing Rust library integration. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Simplicity**: No external dependencies on complex libraries
2. **Reliability**: Fewer moving parts means fewer points of failure
3. **Control**: Complete control over the sync mechanism and conflict resolution

The current implementation:

1. Uses file system watching for changes to sync files
2. Implements a heartbeat system to detect other active devices
3. Provides robust conflict resolution based on user-configured strategies
4. Is designed to work alongside external sync tools like Syncthing if users choose to use them

For users who want more advanced sync capabilities, the file-based approach is compatible with external tools like Dropbox, Google Drive, or Syncthing that can be set up to sync the designated folder.
